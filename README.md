# Ecommerce_Assignment_Shraddha
In todays lab exam we created  a new eccommerce project named exam with app ecom. In ecom under urls.py  we add the code which helps to handel file of main project URLs. We created a model name lab exam and added the following property inside it:
•	id (Auto-increment, IntegerField) 
•	exam_date (DateField) 
•	exam_name (CharField) 
•	exam_description (TextField) 
•	total_marks (FloatField) 
•	pass_marks (FloatField) 
•	exam_status (BooleanField)
After we added the modules we should register that form into admin.py.After we do so we write a function to get and display products from our database and we will set dynamic URL which can be useful to display our products . Lastly we migrate our project and create a super user .
